	<h1>Journey</h1>
	<p>I started at the University of Maryland undecided. As a freshman in college I set a few goals - by the end of this thing I wanted to be running the business of that cool racing club, which would hopefully lead to a cool job in the car industry. Academically I knew I wanted to minor in Spanish (but definitely not major!) and study abroad in a Spanish-speaking country that hopefully wasn't Spain. And that was pretty much it for the tangible goals. With the caveat that I "settled" for Spain, I checked off all of those goals.

	<p>That cool racing club was Terps Racing. Freshman year, our faculty advisor sent out a survey about who wanted to be on what subteam. The results showed one person who wanted to be on the business team. He asked who that was, and I raised my hand. And from there, I ran the business side of Terps Racing</p>
